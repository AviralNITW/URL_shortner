# URL_shortner

A simple and secure full-stack URL shortener built with modern technologies.

✨ Features
Quick Shortening: Easily shorten long URLs.
Persistent Storage: Utilizes MongoDB for reliable data storage.
Authenticated Sessions: Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Secure Authentication: Implements cookie-based login.
Dashboard Functionality: Provides pagination, sorting, and filtering for managing URLs.
Production Ready: Fully deployed and ready for use.
🚀 Tech Stack
💻 Frontend
Framework: React with Vite bundler for a fast development experience.
Routing: TanStack Router for efficient client-side navigation.
Forms & Validation: TanStack Form integrated with Zod for robust form handling and validation.
State Management: Zustand for a simple and powerful state management solution.
HTTP Client: Axios for making API requests.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
⚙️ Backend
Runtime: Node.js with Express.js for a flexible and scalable server.
Database: MongoDB (managed with Mongoose) for data persistence.
Authentication: JWT (access & refresh tokens) for secure API authentication.
Security & Utilities: Includes libraries like bcrypt for password hashing, cookie-parser for handling cookies, cors for managing cross-origin requests, dotenv for environment variables, and nanoid for generating unique URL IDs.
🌐 Deployment
Frontend: Deployed on Vercel.
Backend: Deployed on Vercel/Render.

Technical Challenges Faced
🔁 SPA Routing on Vercel
When deployed, refreshing a route like /dashboard caused a 404 NOT_FOUND error because Vercel by default doesn't handle SPA client-side routing.
✅ Fix: Added a vercel.json with a catch-all rewrite rule to route unknown paths to index.html.

🍪 Cookie-Based Auth & CORS
Since the app uses HttpOnly cookies for JWT authentication across domains:

Had to set credentials: true in Axios globally to allow cookies to be sent.
Configured backend CORS properly with credentials: true and origin set to the frontend URL.
Set cookies with SameSite: None and Secure: true to allow cross-site usage in production.
🧠 Zustand Auth State & Refresh Persistence
On a page refresh, Zustand state resets — initially this caused the app to wrongly assume the user was logged out.

✅ Fix: Introduced isAuthReady flag in Zustand.
Made main layout wait (loadBefore) for auth.store.ready in TanStack Router before rendering protected routes.
Prevented race conditions where Dashboard would redirect to /login before auth status was actually known.
